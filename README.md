# Atlas: A Learning Journey

_A curated collection of knowledge and discoveries_

Atlas is a personal project documenting my learning journey across various technologies and concepts. This repository serves as both a learning journal and a reference guide, mapping out the essential topics I've explored in fields.

Each section in Atlas dives into key ideas, from foundational concepts to more advanced techniques. Whether you're just starting out or looking for specific topics, Atlas is designed to be flexible and easy to navigate.

## How to Use Atlas

You can use Atlas in two main ways:

- **Sequentially**: Follow the topics in the order theyâ€™re presented to gain a structured understanding of each subject.
- **On-demand**: Jump directly to the sections that interest you, using Atlas as a reference for specific topics.

Each chapter is self-contained, making it easy to explore one section without needing to fully read the others.

## Getting Started

To read Atlas locally, you can build and serve the book using `mdBook`. Follow these steps:

1. Install [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/yourusername/atlas.git
```

3. Navigate into the project directory and serve the book:

```bash
cd atlas
mdBook serve --open
```

This will host Atlas on a local server, which you can view in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
