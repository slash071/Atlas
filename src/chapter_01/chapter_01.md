## What is Markdown

It is a writing format as supposed to a publishing format like HTML or
PDF. Writing format is the original source for a writing document like a
blog post. Markdown is based in plain text/human-readable.
As a minimal markup language it provides a simple, compact
syntax (formatting) so it doesn't get in the way of your content.

Markdown is a lightweight open source markup language that you can use
to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

## Flavors of Markdown

There are several variations of Markdown. As such, Markdown does not
have an official standard format.
There are 4 major variations of Markdown which we can flavor:

- Markdown (Original, John Gruber)
- Enhanced Versions
  - Markdown extra
  - Multi-Markdown
  - GitHub Flavored Markdown
  - Several More

> Probably the most commonly used flavored today is the one used by
> GitHub.

## Why Markdown

- Markdown is a simple format based on plain text which any editor
  can read and edit.
- The format is lightweight, which means it has minimal effect on the
  original content.
- Markdown has become widely supported, with editors on nearly every
  platform and device.
- Use for Writing / Publish to HTML / PDF / other

As stated above, you should use Markdown as your source writing
format and then use tools to publish your content into various others
formats as needed. For example, you can publish to an HTML for a blog
post or create a PDF document for printing or both from the same
Markdown document.
